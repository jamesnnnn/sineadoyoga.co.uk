		<h2>About Sin&eacute;ad</h2>
		<div class="about-me-flex">
			<div class="about-me-image" style="background-image:url('images/stock/sinead14.jpg')"></div>
			<div>
				<p>I started going to yoga classes in my early 20s. At the start, I’d usually be late dashing to get to a class on time and letting my ego run away with me fixated on ‘getting’ certain postures.</p>
				<p>Eventually, I started getting to classes earlier, soaking up the time at the start to have a lay down and a gentle wiggle and slowly learning not to force myself into postures or do every vinyasa if I was tired. I began to listen more to what my body needed, rather than looking around the room. I loved the flowing aspect of yoga connecting movement to the breath and how I felt calmer after. I started to prioritise my yoga practise more and more, incorporating mediation and slower paced classes into my week.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>No matter how I’m feeling yoga has been a constant part of my life. Whether I&#39;ve had a bad day and needed someone to tell me to breath a little deeper and spent most of the class in childs pose or when I’m feeling energetic and confident to give new things a try no matter if I wobble or fall. I always come back to my mat and this wonderful practice again and again.</p>
		<p>I have been teaching yoga for three years now. My aim as a teacher is to provide a non judgmental space to be yourself, to encourage you to move your body in a way that feels good, to release any tension from the day and to find a gentle pause from internal loops. I also love to share some of the many pockets of wisdom from yoga philosophy to hopefully help you find a little bit more ease on and off the mat.</p>
		<p>I completed my 200-hour Vinyasa Flow teacher training with Angela Jervis-Read and Holly McFee and studied 100- hour Advanced Yoga Philosophy and Meditation with Hali Schwartz.</p>
		
		<h2>About Vinyasa Flow</h2>
		<div class="about-me-flex vinyasa">
			<div>
				<p>Vinyasa Flow is a wonderful practice to help lift your mood, release any tension and shift some energy about. In a vinyasa class we move with each inhale and exhale, using the breath to help us to connect to our bodies and the present moment; like a moving mediation.</p>
		
		What to expect: 
			<ul>
				<li>we&#39;ll start each class slow, taking time to settle, connecting to our breathing, and letting go of the day</li>
				<li>we&#39;ll move with the breath, flowing through a sequence of standing postures; to help build strength and stretch out the whole body</li>
				<li>there will be some balances to help clear the mind - it’s difficult to think about your ‘to do list’ when you&#39;re standing on one leg</li>
				<li>there will be options so you have the autonomy to make choices that work best for you on that day and rest is always encouraged</li>
				<li>we’ll focus on what the postures feel like in the body rather than trying to &#39;get a posture&#39;</li>
				<li>we&#39;ll finish with a gentle softer stretch out alongside deeper breathing (pranayama)</li>
				<li>each class finishes with a delicious restorative rest (savasana)</li>
			</ul>
